# Food = Pizza Hut

Pizza project was among the projects that I implemented through Linkedin.
This work was based on an actual existing design, which is the original Pizza Hut site. 

The CEO of LoadServe Company created this site again in a period of no more than 7 days and no less
I converted it into a code and the deal was finalized with that company.
The work was very different and it was a useful experience 
at the same time.
